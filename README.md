# STL in C

This project aims to create a library similar to C++'s STL for C.

Note: this is a work in progress. As of the last commit, basic vector implementations have been added.

## Dependencies

* cmake >= 3.11.3

* make >= 4.1 (Linux and Mac), 3.81 (Windows)

* gcc/g++ >= 5.4

## Building: Compile and Run

### Note:
This is a work in progress. Right now, it creates an executable called TestSTL instead of creating a library. That will be changed once the library is complete. The executable currently tests the library.

### Compilation

1. Create a `build` directory and enter it: `mkdir build && cd build`
2. Compile the code by using cmake and make with the following line:
```
cmake .. && make
```

### Execution

The executable is called `TestSTL` and is placed in the build directory. Run the program with the following command:

```
./TestSTL
```

Please note that this executable simply tests the library to see if it works.

More details in this README coming soon!

## Usage in C
This is a work in progress. More details coming soon.
